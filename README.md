# Ellucian Ethos Integration C# SDK Examples

The Ethos Integration C# SDK (EICSSDK) provides utilities and libraries that make it easier for developers to quickly start building Ethos-based integrations.

This is an example library that illustrates how to use the various clients of the EICSSDK. Some of the
examples provided use the EICSSDK object library to enable JavaBean property access when handling API
requests/responses.  

The examples can be tweaked as needed, but should be runnable, though an API key is required to run them.
Each example class contains its own main method and can be run individually. All example classes are found under the
`Ellucian.Examples` namespace.
